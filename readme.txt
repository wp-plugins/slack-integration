 = FOR DEVELOPERS =
 You can send custom Slack notifications within your theme or plugin . To achieve this, **slack-wordpress** declares a global variable `$slack_plugin` for you. You can send notification like this :

     <?php
     global $slack_plugin;
     $channel_to_post = 'CXXXXXXXX';
     $msg = 'test';
     $slack_plugin->getApi()->publish_post($channel_to_post, $msg);

 `publish_post()` returns response of [chat.postMessage](https://api.slack.com/methods/chat.postMessage) , you can look at **Response** section. Also you can check **Formatting** section to formatting your message.
